"""
Demo 1 (Remote): Financial Advisor with Remote Memory Service
==============================================================

This demo showcases the same functionality as demo1_financial_advisor.py,
but using the remote memory service via RemoteMemoryProvider.

Key differences from embedded version:
- No CosmosDB/OpenAI clients in client code
- Much simpler setup (just service URL and user_id)
- Memory service handles all state management
- 0ms session restoration for hot sessions

Scenario:
- Session 1: User discusses retirement planning, reveals risk profile
- Session 2: (New thread) User asks about investments - agent remembers profile  
- Session 3: (New thread) Tax strategies - agent recalls all previous context
