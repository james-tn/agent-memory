Demo 4: Medical Assistant with Explicit Memory Search

This demo showcases the search_memory() tool for on-demand memory retrieval.
Unlike automatic context injection, search_memory() allows the agent to 
explicitly search for specific information when needed.

Scenario:
- Session 1: Initial patient visit - record medical history, medications, allergies
- Session 2: Follow-up visit - explicitly search for past medications
- Session 3: New symptom - search for drug interactions with known allergies

The agent proactively uses search_memory() to retrieve relevant patient history
before making recommendations or answering questions.

    print("""
1. **Automatic Context Injection**:
   - At each session start, relevant memory is automatically provided
   - Enables basic continuity (greeting returning patient, etc.)

2. **Explicit Memory Search**:
   - Agent uses search_memory() tool to actively retrieve specific information
   - Searches for "allergies" before prescribing medications
   - Looks up "past medications" when making recommendations
   - Retrieves "previous symptoms" to provide context-aware care

3. **Hybrid Strategy Benefits**:
   - Automatic: Provides general context and continuity
   - On-demand: Enables precise retrieval for critical decisions
   - Together: Creates proactive, safe, personalized care

4. **When to Use search_memory()**:
   - Before making important decisions (prescriptions, procedures)
   - When patient mentions something from past visits
   - To verify information before taking action
   - When specific historical details are needed

This demonstrates how search_memory() enhances agent capabilities beyond
passive context injection, enabling proactive information retrieval.
