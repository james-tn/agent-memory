"""
Demo 1: Financial Advisor with CosmosDB Memory
==============================================

This demo showcases:
- Long-term user insights (risk tolerance, financial goals)
- Session summaries (previous consultation topics)
- Cumulative context (building knowledge across conversations)
- Personalized recommendations based on history
- Multi-session continuity
- New thread with memory retention

Scenario:
- Session 1: User discusses retirement planning, reveals risk profile
- Session 2: (New thread) User asks about investments - agent remembers profile
- Session 3: (New thread) Tax strategies - agent recalls all previous context
