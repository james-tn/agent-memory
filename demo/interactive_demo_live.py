            ("What are the contribution limits for 2024?", "For 2024, the Roth IRA contribution limit is $7,000 if you're under 50, or $8,000 if you're 50 or older. However, there are income limits that phase out your eligibility."),

            ("I'm generally conservative with investments", "I understand. For conservative investors, I'd recommend a balanced portfolio: 60% stocks (US and international index funds) and 40% bonds. This provides growth potential while managing risk. As you get closer to retirement, we can shift even more conservative."),
            ("That sounds good. I'll start with $500/month", "Excellent choice! $500/month equals $6,000 per year - that's 86% of the maximum. This disciplined approach will serve you well. Let's set up automatic transfers so you never miss a contribution. Would you like help choosing funds?"),

Since you're already contributing $6,000/year ($500/month), you could increase to $583/month to hit the full $7,000 maximum. Even an extra $83/month compounds significantly over 30 years!"),

            ("They match 50% up to 6% of salary", "Perfect! On $110k, contributing 6% ($6,600/year) gets you a $3,300 match. Combined with your $7,200 Roth IRA ($600/month), you're saving $17,100/year for retirement. That's excellent for someone at 35!"),

            ("Probably $500/month. How much would that add to my retirement?", "Great! $500/month ($6,000/year) over 20 years at 7% return adds approximately $260,000 to your retirement nest egg. Combined with your 401k, you'd be looking at $1.1M+ by age 65."),

            ("So total retirement income would be?", "Let's calculate: With $1.1M saved, using the 4% withdrawal rule, you'd have $44,000/year from savings plus $30,000-36,000 from Social Security = $74,000-80,000 annual retirement income. That's about 62-67% of your current income."),
            ("Is that enough?", "Many financial planners recommend 70-80% of pre-retirement income. You're close! To reach 80% ($96,000/year), you'd need about $1.5M saved. That means increasing total contributions from $1,200/month to around $1,700/month. Is that feasible?"),
            ("That's tight. What if I work until 67?", "Working 2 extra years helps significantly! It gives investments more time to grow, delays withdrawals, and increases Social Security benefits by about 16%. You'd likely exceed your 80% target without increasing contributions."),
